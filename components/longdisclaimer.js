            <h1>Risk Warning</h1>

                <p>Before deciding to participate in the financial markets, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience and risk appetite. Most importantly, do not invest money you cannot afford to lose.</p>
                <br /><p>All technical indicators purchased from ThinkTRadeProfit.com are used at the buyers discretion and risk.  No guarantees are made of profitability, and all trading strategies are used at your own risk.</p>
                <br /><p>By purchasing an indicator from ThinkTradeProfit.com, you agree to release all liability from the developer for any trading losses that might be incurred</p>
                <br /><p>There is considerable exposure to risk in any investment or trading transaction, including, but not limited to, leverage, creditworthiness, limited regulatory protection and market volatility that may substantially affect the price, or liquidity of a currency or currency pair, stock, option, future or other financial position.</p>
                <br /><p>Moreover, the leveraged nature of Forex, futures, cryptocurrency, and other leveraged asset trading trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds. This may work against you as well as for you. The possibility exists that you could sustain a total loss of initial margin funds and be required to deposit additional funds to maintain your position. If you fail to meet any margin requirement, your position may be liquidated and you will be responsible for any resulting losses.</p>
